# portfolio-resume
A place to put links and pictures of projects I want potential employers to see.

 
In additional to some fun projects with general programming, I'm going to put in
some of my favorite visualizations and Machine Learning work. Any of this stuff
could be completely-guided-from-tutorials or completely-original, or anywhere 
in between.

I'll just use links here, with each link pointing to a markdown file in the 
`porftfolio-resume` repo with. Each of these markdown files will have with a 
short description of the project and any visualization, some images with 
screencaps, and a link to the main repo; it will be a presentation page. Here, 
I'll be making a list of the projects with links to each presentation page I 
described above. There will also be a link to each actual repo with the 
full project. Since I leave the notebooks without output, so that you can run
through them yourself, I'm going to add two waysFinally, if I get things all figured out for them to work, I'll
put a link to an online, interactive Jupyter Notebook made available thanks
to the [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/) project. 

# Higgs Boson Visualization

This was my chance to return to grad school, where I studied Nuclear/Particle
Physics. The goal was to do the data analysis to "re-discover" the Higgs Boson - 
also called the God Particle. I got the data, prepared it, and ran the
analysis to create a histogram that looks pretty similar to the publicatin's
discovery figure. Below is a sneak peak at my work and the discovery figure.


# Does My Application and Résumé Match the Job Description?

This is a nice project that contains some fundamental parts of Natural Language
Processing. I use it for my job applications. Currently, I'm running it for
a job that really interests me, using AI?ML and Data Science to help in the
medical-imaging business.

# Convolutional Neural Network for Natural Language Processing - CNN for NLP (in PyTorch)

This is a better answer to a job interview question that I felt I didn't answer very
well. It's a nice combination of NLP and Machine Learning basics.

\[To put on the presentation page\]

This is my favorite, nice, and simple code for a simple CNN, created using PyTorch. I
really like how I did the first part - using the (Transformer-type/LLM) AI to do each
of the steps described by the teacher in the course this project follows. That course is
[_Natural Language Processing with PyTorch_](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/natural-language-processing-with-pytorch/), 
taugh by Zhongyou Pan. Note that it's a LinkedIn course, and thus will require a login, 
which itself will require an account.


# One of the Classics - CNN for MNIST Digit Recognition (in TensorFlow)

Can we read the numbers in zip codes that people write on their Post-Office envelopes?
The MNIST digit database and challenge give us the chance to find out.
